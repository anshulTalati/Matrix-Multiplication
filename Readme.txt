          2) Implementation of the Matrix Multiplication by Map-Reduce Framework and Java as programming language.

Note - For spark Implementation
		The output for the small matrix dataset is in the log file matrixspark.local.output
		The output for the large matrix dataset is in the log file matrixspark.distr.output
	

Datasets Used - Matrix dataset M-matrix-large.txt,N-matrix-large.txt,M-matrix-small.txt, N-matrix-small.txt
